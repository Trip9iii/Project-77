To set up visual studio you need to go to their website. Then find the downloads, and select the download for which ever device you are using. After that you need to make a folder, you can nmae it whatever you want. And lastly open it and install a few extensions for it.

<p>
    In the Visual Studio Options Dialog -> Debugging -> Check the "Redirect All Output Window Text to the Immediate Window".
     Then go to your project settings and change the type from "Console Application" to "Windows Application". 
     At that point Visual Studio does not open up a console window anymore, and the output is redirected to the Output window in Visual Studio. 
     However, you cannot do anything "creative", like requesting key or text input, or clearing the console - you'll get runtime exceptions.
